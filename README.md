# hydrogenoti
Hydrogenoti is a device that produces hydrogen from water and fills it into a balloon to build harmless hydrogen bombs (they are not radioactive).
I design it using Fusion360 and print it with PETG.

## **container**

In total, it is 160mm high and 60mm Ø.

The shape is like a bottle, ideal to bring the gas smoothly from the electrodes into the bomb.
The balloon is held on the tube at the top:

At its lower side, the tube is slimmer than at the top to hold the balloon if it is filled.

## **electronics**

I didn't make a wiring diagram because it would be just two wires :D. 
The electrodes are nine. So I had to choose to which pole 5 of them will be connected. I chose GND, because there will be more hydrogen than oxygen on the surfaces of the electrodes. The GND-electrodes are arranged in the corners and in the middle. VCC uses the remaining electrodes, of course.

They are all connected as shown in the picture:

The graphite sticks will be mounted like this into the holes under the container:
